{"name":"Cinister","tagline":"A tiny CoffeeScript web framework","body":"Cinister is a tiny evolving web framework  (under MIT license) in CoffeeScript and Node.js heavily inspired\r\nby Ruby's excellent Sinatra and Python's Flask frameworks. I'm mainly writing this to learn both CoffeeScript, JavaScript and Node.js at the same time.\r\n\r\nHuh?\r\n======================\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main goal is to keep things simple, currently it supports RESTful URL patterns for tiny apps and GET, POST, PUT and DELETE http methods.\r\nBut overtime it will provide more Jelly and Tomatoes for the stars! So how does it work?\r\n\r\n* You gonna need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed for this.\r\n* Also, since its a [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) (sip) project you need to install that as well.\r\n\r\n**Getting Cinister**\r\n\r\nYou can download the source code from the above links or more simply can run this from npm\r\n\r\n`npm install cinister`\r\n\r\nCinister has dependency on [`ejs`, `connect`, `querystring`]\r\n\r\n**Creating an app**\r\n\r\nWe are going to make a simple app that says 'Hi' on launch and runs on localhost at port 9000.\r\n\r\n`cin = require 'cinister'`\r\n\r\nThis gets Cin classes and functions ready for your app.\r\n\r\n`cin.port 9000`\r\n\r\nThis sets the port of our app server to 9000.\r\n\r\n`cin.get '/', -> '<h1>Hi</h1>'`\r\n\r\nThis creates a route for our app. The route is root or '/' and on hitting it the page will greet you with Hi.\r\n\r\n`cin.start()`\r\n\r\nAnd finally this starts the app.\r\n\r\nPut the above lines in a file, say app1.coffee, and run\r\n\r\n`coffee app1.coffee`\r\n\r\nNow navigate to http://localhost:9000/ to see your message.\r\n\r\nCinister is written in CoffeeScript but that doesn't mean it can't run with plain vanilla JavaScript. Cinister can be used along with just Node.js in the same way as above. Here's a much contrived example in JavaScript -\r\n\r\n[Cinister in JavaScript](https://gist.github.com/souravdatta/5538500)\r\n\r\n**RESTful URLS**\r\n\r\nCinister supports various patterns of URLs and methods. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n    cin.get 'users/:name', (params) -> console.log params\r\n\r\nThe params parameter will contain all the `:argument`s as key/value pairs. The key will be `argument` and value will the be the corresponding part in the URL. EXCEPT for the key `redirect`. This special key will always return a function which can be used to redirect to another url. So if the a GET request has URL `users/John`, `params.name` will be `'John'`.\r\n\r\n    cin.get 'users/:name/len*', (params) -> \"#{params['name']} and #{params.splat[0]}\"\r\n    cin.get 'users/:name/*/*', (params) -> console.log params\r\n    cin.get 'users/:name/*/and/*', (params) -> console.log params\r\n\r\nAnd, to redirect to a new url\r\n\r\n    cin.get '/users/name/:name', (params) ->\r\n      if params.name == 'John Snow'\r\n        params.redirect '/wall'\r\n      else\r\n        \"Hello there <b><i>#{params.name}</i></b>\"\r\n\r\nA star indicates one or more characters and the matched URL parts are kept as an array in `params['splat']`. A `*.*` matches all file names with any extensions.\r\n\r\n    cin.put 'users', (params) -> console.log 'PUT ', params\r\n    cin.delete 'foods', (params) -> console.log 'DEL ', params\r\n    cin.post 'apaches', (params) -> console.log 'POST', params\r\n\r\nThe `params` argument receives a nested Object called `query` which stores the parsed body part of the HTTP request. For GET requests is taken from the URL itself and for other requests the body of the request is parsed using Node.js querystring module.\r\n\r\nView the associated cintest*.coffee files for usage examples in CoffeeScript.\r\n\r\n**Sessions**\r\n\r\nCinister uses Connect as the middleware. For now Cinister has minimal support for session management. Sessions are not enabled by default, but can be enabled by\r\n`cinister.enable_session` function. The `params` parameter of the callback handlers always receieves an object under `params.session`. When the sessions are enabled, this contains the current session object. Here's one small example of how to use it\r\n\r\n    cin.enable_session()\r\n\r\n    cin.get 'message', (params) ->\r\n      sess = params.session\r\n      if sess && sess.name\r\n        \"hello, #{sess.name}\\n\"\r\n      else\r\n        'hi, one who must not be named\\n'\r\n\r\n    cin.get 'message/:name', (params) ->\r\n      sess = params.session\r\n      if sess\r\n        sess['name'] = params['name']\r\n      'Done\\n'\r\n\r\n**View templates**\r\n\r\nCinister supports a basic template system which uses the wonderful EJS module. The templates are written in EJS format. Refer to EJS for a detailed description of how to write templates.\r\nThe default location for the view templates are ./views directory. However, a separate location can be specified while rendering. Below are two simple examples from cintest2.coffee:\r\n\r\n    cin.get 'view1', (params) ->\r\n      cin.ejs 'view1', name: 'Sourav', job: 'Programmer'\r\n\r\n    cin.get 'view2', ->\r\n      cin.ejs 'view1', name: 'View2', job: 'Not sure', 'view2'\r\n\r\nIn the first case, cinister looks for `view1.ejs` under `./views` directory. In the second case it looks for `view1.ejs` under `./view2` directory instead.\r\n\r\n**What Cinister is for**\r\n\r\nCinister is mainly for writing quick web apps with small number of interfaces. It is also great for testing and exposing small sets of REST APIs which not only browsers but applications like `curl` can be used to access.\r\n\r\n**What Cinister is not for**\r\n\r\nSerious web applications, use Express, Rails or even Sinatra. Currently it has very minimal support for sessions, but authentication/cookies will probably be added later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***License***\r\n***\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Sourav Datta (soura.jagat@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated\r\ndocumentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the\r\nrights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\r\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the\r\nSoftware.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
